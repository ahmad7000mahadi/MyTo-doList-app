            I created the MyToDoList app with simplicity in mind. It all started from my own experiences with to-do list apps. What I noticed is that those apps often let me write super long texts for each task, which, as a user, got kinda confusing. After all, a to-do list is all about jotting down quick, short tasks for your daily life, right?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="how-to-use-content">
            So, to tackle this, I designed MyToDoList to keep things snappy. You can't write more than 20 characters per task, or you'll get a friendly warning pop-up. This should help you keep your thoughts organized and your to-dos on point.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="how-to-use-content">
            Using MyToDoList is a breeze. Just type in stuff like "buy some food," "watch YouTube," or "do homework." You can add tasks, check off the ones you've finished, and even hit delete if you change your mind.

        <p class="how-to-use-content">
            finally. if you have any suggestions for the app or spot any bugs/errors, don't hesitate to shoot me an email. This is version 1.0.0, so I'm all ears for your feedback.
            <br>
            Cheers,
